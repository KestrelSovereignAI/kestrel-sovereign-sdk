"""Kestrel SDK — Signal Dispatcher interfaces.

Types and contracts that any signal source must develop against. The
runtime (`SignalDispatcher`, `SourceRegistry`, lock manager, signal_log
store) lives in `kestrel_sovereign.signals` and should never be imported
from feature packages — depend on these types instead.

Design: docs/architecture/SIGNAL_DISPATCHER.md (in the sovereign repo).

"""
TrainingProvider Protocol for unified LoRA training across providers.

This protocol abstracts the differences between:
- Serverless providers (Vertex AI, Replicate) - job runs to completion
- Session-based providers (GCP Compute, RunPod, Vast.ai) - requires instance lifecycle

All providers expose the same interface; session management is hidden internally.

Usage:
    from kestrel_sovereign.features.training import TrainingProviderFactory, TrainingConfig
    from kestrel_sovereign.kestrel_config.constants import TRAINING_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS

    # Get default provider (auto-detected from environment)
    provider = TrainingProviderFactory.get_default_provider()

    # Or get specific provider
    provider = TrainingProviderFactory.get_provider("vertex_ai")

    # Start training
    job = await provider.start_training(
        companion_id="abc123",
        avatar_data=image_bytes,
        config=TrainingConfig(steps=1000, lora_rank=16)
    )

    # Poll for completion
    while True:
        status = await provider.get_status(job.job_id)
        if status.state.is_terminal():
            break
        await asyncio.sleep(TRAINING_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS)

    # Download weights
    if status.state == TrainingState.COMPLETED:
        lora_bytes = await provider.download_weights(job.job_id)
        # Store lora_bytes to database

    # Cleanup (important for session-based providers)
    await provider.cleanup(job.job_id)
